Approximately 5 million new cases of gastrointestinal cancer are reported every year around the world, and 3.4 million result in deaths. Of these patients, only about half are eligible for radiation therapy.Radiation therapy necessitates the delivery of high doses of X-ray beam radiation pointed at tumors. Radiation oncologists must try to avoid the stomach and intestines while administering the treatment. However, even with the latest technologies such as MR-Linacs which allow the daily visualization of the position of the tumor and intestines, oncologists have to manually outline the position of the stomach and intestines daily in order to calibrate the direction of the x-ray beams. Unfortunately, this is both a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that can prolong daily treatments significantly, which can be difficult for patients to tolerate.

Our goal is to effectively track the stomach, large bowel, and small bowel in GI Track MRI scans. Solving the problem will enable radiation oncologists to safely administer higher doses of radiation to tumors while avoiding the stomach and intestines. This will make cancer patientsâ€™ daily treatments faster and allow them to get more effective treatment with fewer side effects and better long-term cancer control.

This project is inspired by the Kaggle competition: UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation. Apart from developing a model that is of high accuracy, we also intend to compare the performance of multiple models. Additionally, since semantic modeling is a black box, we are aiming to discern which pixels are critical in distinguishing the segments.
